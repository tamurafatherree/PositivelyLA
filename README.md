# PositivelyLA
Potential project to highlight the rich history of South LA


South LA is often viewed through a negative lens.  
Its rich history is unknown, overlooked, or simply forgotten.
The goal of this project is to enlighten users on the many facets of this vibrant community.


Should we put the planning canvas on a wiki or create a project?  Or, maybe we should just create individual pages for each section, "The Problem", "The Solution", and "The Logistics"
